## 🎯 Demo 1: Interactive Security Code Review with Copilot Chat

**Objective:** Demonstrate conversational security analysis finding auth/authz vulnerabilities  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Files:** `demos/auth-api/server.js`, `demos/auth-api/middleware/auth.js`

### Setup (Pre-demo)

```bash
# Navigate to demo directory
cd demos/auth-api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify vulnerable API runs
npm start

# Test endpoint (should return 200)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/profile -H "Authorization: Bearer test"

# Stop server (Ctrl+C)
```

### Demo Script

**Step 1: Open Copilot Chat and provide architectural context**

Open `server.js` in VS Code, then open Copilot Chat panel.

```
PROMPT 1: "I need a security code review of this Express.js API. The architecture:

- Express REST API with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (admin, user roles)
- User profile endpoints with PII
- Deployed to Azure App Service with internet access
- Processes sensitive user data (email, profile info)

Focus on authentication and authorization vulnerabilities. Use OWASP Top 10 as framework."
```

**What Copilot Should Find:**

- JWT signature validation bypass (HS256 vs RS256 confusion)
- Missing token expiration enforcement
- Hardcoded JWT secret in code
- Authorization bypass via role manipulation
- Information disclosure in error messages

**Step 2: Drill into specific findings**

```
PROMPT 2: "Show me the JWT validation code. Does it properly verify the signature? Check for algorithm confusion vulnerabilities."
```

**Expected Response:** Copilot identifies that `jwt.verify()` is called but doesn't restrict algorithms, allowing HS256/RS256 confusion attack.

```
PROMPT 3: "Check the authorization middleware. Can a user escalate privileges by modifying the JWT payload?"
```

**Expected Response:** Copilot finds that role checking trusts JWT payload without cryptographic validation.

**Step 3: Generate STRIDE threat model**

```
PROMPT 4: "Generate a STRIDE threat model for this API architecture. Consider:
- API is internet-accessible
- Uses JWT bearer token authentication
- Stores user PII in MongoDB
- Deployed as single Azure App Service instance

Provide specific attack scenarios for each STRIDE category."
```

**Expected Output Structure:**

```
STRIDE Threat Model for Auth API

**Spoofing:**
- Attacker forges JWT tokens using HS256/RS256 algorithm confusion
- Session token theft via XSS (if tokens stored in localStorage)

**Tampering:**
- Modify JWT role claims to gain admin privileges
- Intercept and modify API requests (requires TLS validation)

**Repudiation:**
- No audit logging of authentication attempts
- User actions not associated with cryptographic identity

**Information Disclosure:**
- Error messages leak system architecture details
- JWT payload reveals user roles and permissions
- Timing attacks on authentication validation

**Denial of Service:**
- No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Computationally expensive JWT verification without caching

**Elevation of Privilege:**
- JWT role manipulation bypasses RBAC
- Admin endpoints accessible with forged admin tokens
```

**Step 4: Export findings as security review report**

```
PROMPT 5: "Generate a security review report in markdown format with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed findings with CWE references
- Severity ratings (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Remediation recommendations with code examples
- OWASP Top 10 mapping"
```

Copy the generated report and save to `security-reports/auth-api-review-2024-11.md`.

### Teaching Points

**Emphasize:**

- Architectural context is critical for accurate security analysis
- Conversational approach finds issues traditional static analysis misses
- STRIDE provides systematic framework for threat identification
- AI accelerates discovery, but human judgment validates findings

**Common Issues:**

- If Copilot gives generic advice, provide more specific architectural details
- If findings are vague, ask follow-up questions drilling into specific code paths
- If threat model is incomplete, prompt for specific STRIDE categories

---

## 🎯 Demo 2: Automated Compliance Reporting from GHAS

**Objective:** Transform GHAS vulnerability data into compliance reports  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Files:** `scripts/compliance-report.js`

### Setup (Pre-demo)

```bash
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd scripts

# Install dependencies
npm install @octokit/rest dotenv

# Set environment variables
cat > .env << 'EOF'
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
REPO_OWNER=your_github_username
REPO_NAME=copilot-security-demos
EOF

# Verify GHAS data is available
node fetch-ghas-data.js

# Should output JSON with CodeQL and Dependabot findings
```

### Demo Script

**Step 1: Query GHAS API for security findings**

Show the `fetch-ghas-data.js` script that queries GitHub's API:

```javascript
// fetch-ghas-data.js - Simplified for demo
const { Octokit } = require("@octokit/rest");

async function fetchSecurityAlerts() {
  const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });

  // Fetch CodeQL SAST findings
  const codeqlAlerts = await octokit.codeScanning.listAlertsForRepo({
    owner: process.env.REPO_OWNER,
    repo: process.env.REPO_NAME,
    state: 'open'
  });

  // Fetch Dependabot vulnerability alerts
  const dependabotAlerts = await octokit.dependabot.listAlertsForRepo({
    owner: process.env.REPO_OWNER,
    repo: process.env.REPO_NAME,
    state: 'open'
  });

  return {
    codeql: codeqlAlerts.data,
    dependabot: dependabotAlerts.data
  };
}

// Execute and save to JSON
fetchSecurityAlerts()
  .then(data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Run the script:

```bash
node fetch-ghas-data.js > ghas-findings.json
```

**Step 2: Use Copilot to generate OWASP Top 10 compliance report**

Open Copilot Chat and provide the GHAS data:

```
PROMPT 1: "Analyze this GHAS vulnerability data and generate an OWASP Top 10 compliance report.

For each finding, identify:
- Which OWASP Top 10 category it maps to
- CWE identifier
- Severity and exploitability
- Current compliance status

[Paste the first 20 lines of ghas-findings.json]

Format as markdown table with columns: Finding | OWASP Category | CWE | Severity | Status"
```

**Expected Output:**

```markdown
# OWASP Top 10 Compliance Report
**Generated:** 2024-11-16
**Repository:** copilot-security-demos

| Finding | OWASP Category | CWE | Severity | Status |
|---------|----------------|-----|----------|--------|
| SQL Injection in login endpoint | A03:2021 Injection | CWE-89 | Critical | Open |
| Hardcoded JWT secret | A07:2021 Auth Failures | CWE-798 | High | Open |
| XSS in search results | A03:2021 Injection | CWE-79 | High | Open |
| Outdated lodash (CVE-2024-xxx) | A06:2021 Vulnerable Components | CWE-1035 | Medium | Open |

**Compliance Summary:**
- A03:2021 Injection: 2 critical findings, 60% remediated
- A07:2021 Identification & Authentication: 1 high finding, 0% remediated
- A06:2021 Vulnerable Components: 1 medium finding, 0% remediated
```

**Step 3: Generate executive summary with risk metrics**

```
PROMPT 2: "Transform this technical report into an executive summary for CISO review. Include:
- Total vulnerability count by severity
- Business impact assessment (focus on PII exposure, compliance risk, revenue impact)
- Estimated remediation timeline and cost
- Regulatory compliance risk (GDPR, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
- Recommended immediate actions

Keep to one page, avoid technical jargon."
```

**Expected Output:**

```markdown
# Security Executive Summary - November 2024

## Risk Overview
**Critical Issues:** 2 requiring immediate attention
**High-Priority Issues:** 3 requiring remediation within 30 days
**Overall Risk Rating:** HIGH

## Business Impact
- **PII Exposure Risk:** SQL injection vulnerability exposes 50K customer records (GDPR Article 33 breach notification required)
- **Authentication Weakness:** Hardcoded secrets could enable account takeover affecting all 1.2M users
- **Compliance Risk:** Current posture fails SOC 2 security controls, blocking enterprise sales pipeline

## Financial Impact
- **Estimated Breach Cost:** $420K (based on 2024 IBM Cost of Data Breach Report)
- **Remediation Cost:** $15K engineering time (80 hours @ blended rate)
- **Revenue at Risk:** $2.3M enterprise deals delayed pending SOC 2 certification

## Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate (24 hours):** Rotate all secrets, deploy WAF rules blocking SQL injection
2. **This Week:** Remediate critical and high severity findings, deploy fixes to production
3. **This Month:** Complete security testing, achieve SOC 2 compliance, resume enterprise sales

**Next Review:** Weekly security meetings until risk rating reduced to MEDIUM
```

**Step 4: Automate weekly security digest via GitHub Actions**

Show the GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-digest.yml
name: Weekly Security Digest

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday at 9 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:     # Allow manual trigger

jobs:
  generate-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        working-directory: ./scripts
      
      - name: Fetch GHAS findings
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: node fetch-ghas-data.js > findings.json
        working-directory: ./scripts
      
      - name: Generate compliance report with Copilot
        run: |
          # Use GitHub Copilot API to generate report
          # (This is a placeholder - actual implementation would use Copilot API)
          echo "Generating compliance report..."
      
      - name: Email security team
        uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v3
        with:
          server_address: smtp.gmail.com
          server_port: 465
          username: ${{ secrets.MAIL_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.MAIL_PASSWORD }}
          subject: Weekly Security Digest - ${{ github.repository }}
          body: file://./scripts/security-report.md
          to: security-team@company.com
          from: GitHub Actions
```

Demonstrate running the workflow:

```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run security-digest.yml

# View workflow run
gh run list --workflow=security-digest.yml
```

### Teaching Points

**Emphasize:**

- GHAS provides data, Copilot provides intelligence and context
- Stakeholder-specific reporting (technical vs executive) drives action
- Automation enables continuous security visibility vs quarterly snapshots
- Trend data (week-over-week changes) is more actionable than point-in-time status

**Common Issues:**

- GitHub API rate limits - cache results, don't query on every request
- If Copilot mapping is inaccurate, provide OWASP/CWE reference documentation
- Executive summaries must include business impact, not just technical severity

## 🎯 Demo 3: Custom Security Linter for Azure Configuration

**Objective:** Build Semgrep rule detecting hardcoded Azure storage connection strings  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Files:** `linters/azure-storage-auth.yml`, `test-cases/`

### Setup (Pre-demo)

```bash
# Navigate to linters directory
cd linters

# Install Semgrep
pip install semgrep

# Verify Semgrep works
semgrep --version
```

### Demo Script

**Step 1: Identify the security anti-pattern**

Show vulnerable code example:

```javascript
// BAD: Hardcoded Azure Storage connection string (CWE-798)
const connectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=mystorageacct;AccountKey=abc123...";
const blobServiceClient = BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
```

Show secure alternative:

```javascript
// GOOD: Using DefaultAzureCredential with managed identity
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
const { BlobServiceClient } = require("@azure/storage-blob");

const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
  "https://mystorageacct.blob.core.windows.net",
  credential
);
```

**Step 2: Use Copilot to generate Semgrep rule**

Open Copilot Chat:

```
PROMPT: "Generate a Semgrep rule that detects hardcoded Azure Storage connection strings in JavaScript and TypeScript code.

The rule should:
- Match string literals containing 'AccountName=' and 'AccountKey='
- Match both single and double quotes
- Detect the pattern in variable assignments and function arguments
- Provide a clear error message explaining the security risk
- Suggest using DefaultAzureCredential instead
- Include severity level: HIGH
- Map to CWE-798 (Use of Hard-coded Credentials)

Output in Semgrep YAML format."
```

**Expected Output:**

```yaml
rules:
  - id: azure-hardcoded-storage-connection-string
    patterns:
      - pattern-either:
          - pattern: |
              "$STRING"
          - pattern: |
              '$STRING'
      - metavariable-regex:
          metavariable: $STRING
          regex: '.*AccountName=.*AccountKey=.*'
    message: |
      Hardcoded Azure Storage connection string detected (CWE-798).
      
      Connection strings contain sensitive credentials that should never be committed to code.
      
      SECURE ALTERNATIVE:
      Use DefaultAzureCredential with managed identity:
      
      const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
      const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
      const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
        "https://ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net",
        credential
      );
      
      Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad
    severity: ERROR
    languages:
      - javascript
      - typescript
    metadata:
      cwe: CWE-798
      owasp: A07:2021 - Identification and Authentication Failures
      references:
        - https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-auth-aad
        - https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html
```

Save to `linters/azure-storage-auth.yml`.

**Step 3: Test the rule against vulnerable and secure code**

Create test cases:

```bash
# Create test directory
mkdir -p test-cases

# Vulnerable code sample
cat > test-cases/vulnerable.js << 'EOF'
// This should trigger the Semgrep rule
const Azure = require('@azure/storage-blob');

const connectionString = "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=devstore;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==";
const blobService = Azure.BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
EOF

# Secure code sample
cat > test-cases/secure.js << 'EOF'
// This should NOT trigger the Semgrep rule
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require('@azure/identity');
const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');

const accountName = process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME;
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
const blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(
  `https://${accountName}.blob.core.windows.net`,
  credential
);
EOF
```

Run Semgrep tests:

```bash
# Test against vulnerable code - should find issue
semgrep --config linters/azure-storage-auth.yml test-cases/vulnerable.js

# Expected output: 1 finding detected

# Test against secure code - should pass
semgrep --config linters/azure-storage-auth.yml test-cases/secure.js

# Expected output: 0 findings
```

**Step 4: Integrate into GitHub Actions for automated enforcement**

Create GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/custom-security-linting.yml
name: Custom Security Linting

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  semgrep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      
      - name: Install Semgrep
        run: pip install semgrep
      
      - name: Run custom Azure security rules
        run: |
          semgrep --config linters/azure-storage-auth.yml \
            --config linters/azure-managed-identity.yml \
            --config linters/azure-key-vault.yml \
            --error \
            --verbose \
            .
      
      - name: Upload results to GitHub Security
        if: always()
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v2
        with:
          sarif_file: semgrep-results.sarif
```

Demonstrate triggering the check:

```bash
# Create a branch with vulnerable code
git checkout -b test-security-linter

# Add vulnerable file
cp test-cases/vulnerable.js src/storage-client.js
git add src/storage-client.js
git commit -m "Add storage client (intentionally vulnerable for demo)"

# Push and create PR
git push origin test-security-linter
gh pr create --title "Test security linter" --body "Testing custom Semgrep rule"

# The GitHub Action should fail the build with clear error message
```

### Teaching Points

**Emphasize:**

- Custom linters catch YOUR organization's specific anti-patterns
- Generic tools (ESLint, Semgrep) can be extended for custom security policies
- Educational error messages reduce repeat violations
- Enforcement in CI prevents vulnerabilities from reaching production

**Common Issues:**

- False positives kill developer trust - test rules thoroughly before enforcement
- Semgrep regex patterns can be tricky - use Copilot to refine and test
- Integration with GitHub Security tab provides visibility across organization

## 🎯 Demo 4: AI-Powered Dependency Vulnerability Workflow

**Objective:** Analyze CVE exploitability and generate automated remediation PRs  
**Duration:** 10 minutes  
**Files:** `scripts/dependency-analysis.js`

### Setup (Pre-demo)

```bash
# Navigate to demo app with known vulnerable dependencies
cd demos/vulnerable-app

# Install dependencies (includes vulnerable packages)
npm install

# Run Dependabot scan
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/dependabot/alerts > dependabot-alerts.json

# You should see alerts for lodash, axios, express, etc.
```

### Demo Script

**Step 1: Fetch Dependabot alerts via GitHub API**

Show the API query script:

```javascript
// scripts/fetch-dependabot-alerts.js
const { Octokit } = require("@octokit/rest");

async function fetchDependabotAlerts() {
  const octokit = new Octokit({ auth: process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN });
  
  const alerts = await octokit.dependabot.listAlertsForRepo({
    owner: process.env.REPO_OWNER,
    repo: process.env.REPO_NAME,
    state: 'open',
    severity: 'critical,high'  // Focus on critical/high only
  });
  
  return alerts.data.map(alert => ({
    number: alert.number,
    package: alert.security_advisory.package.name,
    vulnerability: alert.security_advisory.summary,
    severity: alert.security_advisory.severity,
    cve: alert.security_advisory.cve_id,
    cvss: alert.security_advisory.cvss.score,
    affectedVersions: alert.security_vulnerability.vulnerable_version_range,
    firstPatchedVersion: alert.security_vulnerability.first_patched_version?.identifier
  }));
}
```

Run and display results:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-dependabot-alerts.js | jq '.[0:3]'
```

**Example output:**

```json
[
  {
    "number": 42,
    "package": "lodash",
    "vulnerability": "Prototype Pollution in lodash",
    "severity": "high",
    "cve": "CVE-2024-1234",
    "cvss": 7.4,
    "affectedVersions": "< 4.17.21",
    "firstPatchedVersion": "4.17.21"
  },
  {
    "number": 43,
    "package": "axios",
    "vulnerability": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "severity": "critical",
    "cve": "CVE-2024-5678",
    "cvss": 9.1,
    "affectedVersions": "< 1.6.5",
    "firstPatchedVersion": "1.6.5"
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Use Copilot to assess CVE exploitability**

For the critical axios SSRF vulnerability, open Copilot Chat:

```
PROMPT: "Analyze CVE-2024-5678 (axios SSRF vulnerability) for exploitability in our context.

ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT:
- We use axios for backend API calls to trusted internal microservices
- All axios requests go to URLs constructed from environment variables
- No user input is directly passed to axios URL construction
- Application runs in Azure App Service with network isolation
- Network security groups restrict outbound traffic to known services

CVE DETAILS:
- Axios versions < 1.6.5 vulnerable to SSRF
- Attack vector: Attacker controls the URL parameter passed to axios.get/post/etc
- Impact: Attacker can make requests to arbitrary internal/external hosts

QUESTIONS:
1. Is this CVE exploitable in our architecture?
2. What is the attack path (if exploitable)?
3. What is the business impact if exploited?
4. Recommended priority: Critical/High/Medium/Low?
5. Can we delay remediation or must we patch immediately?"
```

**Expected Response:**

```markdown
EXPLOITABILITY ANALYSIS: CVE-2024-5678 (Axios SSRF)

1. **Is this exploitable?** UNLIKELY in your current architecture

2. **Attack path analysis:**
   - The vulnerability requires attacker-controlled URL input to axios calls
   - Your architecture uses URLs from environment variables, not user input
   - Network security groups limit outbound traffic
   - Attack would require:
     a) Finding a code path where user input influences env vars (unlikely)
     b) Bypassing NSG restrictions (blocked at network layer)

3. **Business impact if exploited:**
   - Potential access to internal Azure metadata service (169.254.169.254)
   - Possible exfiltration of sensitive config data
   - Lateral movement to internal services (if NSGs misconfigured)
   
4. **Recommended priority:** MEDIUM (not immediate)
   - Vulnerability exists but exploitation path is blocked
   - Defense-in-depth still warrants patching
   - Include in next normal update cycle

5. **Can we delay?** YES, within reason
   - Not an emergency patch
   - Schedule for next sprint (within 30 days)
   - Monitor for NSG changes that could widen attack surface
   
RECOMMENDATION: Include in next dependency update batch. Add detection rule
for user-influenced axios URL construction to prevent future risk.
```

**Step 3: Generate pull request with dependency upgrade and code fixes**

For a truly exploitable vulnerability, demonstrate automated PR generation:

```
PROMPT: "Generate a pull request for upgrading axios from 1.5.0 to 1.6.5.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Update package.json and package-lock.json
2. Identify breaking changes from axios changelog
3. Update code that uses deprecated axios features
4. Add tests validating the upgrade
5. Generate PR description with:
   - Security justification (CVE reference)
   - Breaking changes summary
   - Testing performed
   - Deployment considerations

OUTPUT: Complete PR as a bash script that creates the branch, makes changes, and opens PR"
```

**Expected Output:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-generated PR for axios CVE-2024-5678 remediation

./scripts/create-security-pr.sh
```

**Step 4: Validate fixes pass security tests before merging**

Show the GitHub Actions workflow that validates security PRs:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-pr-validation.yml
name: Security PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  security-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'security')
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: npm run test:integration
      
      - name: CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      
      - name: Dependency vulnerability scan
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
      
      - name: Verify CVE is fixed
        run: |
          # Check that the vulnerable dependency version is no longer present
          if npm list axios@1.5.0 2>/dev/null; then
            echo "ERROR: Vulnerable axios version still present"
            exit 1
          fi
          echo "✅ Vulnerable version removed"
      
      - name: Security test suite
        run: npm run test:security
      
      - name: Auto-approve if all checks pass
        if: success()
        uses: hmarr/auto-approve-action@v3
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Teaching Points

**Emphasize:**

- Not all CVEs are exploitable in every context - architecture matters
- Exploitability analysis focuses human effort on real risks
- Automated PRs still require human validation and testing
- Security test automation provides confidence in dependency upgrades

**Common Issues:**

- Breaking changes in major version upgrades require careful testing
- False confidence in "automatic" fixes - always validate manually
- Integration test coverage is critical for safe dependency updates

## 💡 Pro Tips for Recording

### Timing

- Code review demo: 10 min (show 2-3 key findings, not every issue)
- Threat modeling: 10 min (show STRIDE analysis, don't read entire output)
- Security audit: 10 min (execute script, show critical findings only)
- Dependency management: 10 min (show prioritization logic, sample PR)

### Copilot Chat Tips

- Start with clean chat history
- Use specific architectural context in prompts
- Show iterative refinement (follow-up questions)
- Demonstrate copy/paste to GitHub for integration

### Common Issues

- If Copilot verbose: Ask for "concise summary"
- If analysis generic: Add more architectural context
- If audit script errors: Verify Azure CLI authentication

### Remember Tim's Voice

- First-principles security explanations
- Real-world breach examples and lessons learned
- Skeptical about automation replacing judgment
- Focus on practical ROI and metrics
