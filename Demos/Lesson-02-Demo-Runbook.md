## 🎬 Demo Sequence 1: Copilot Security Knowledge (10 min)

### Objective

Demonstrate that Copilot understands security patterns from training, not just generic code completion

### Demo 1.1: Copilot Knows Cryptographic Correctness (3 min)

**Setup:**
Create empty file: `encryption-demo.js`

**Live Coding with Copilot:**

```javascript
// Type this comment, let Copilot complete:
// Encrypt data using AES-256-GCM with secure IV generation

// Watch Copilot suggest implementation
```

**Expected Copilot Suggestion:**

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function encrypt(plaintext, key) {
  // Generate cryptographically secure IV (12 bytes for GCM)
  const iv = crypto.randomBytes(12);

  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', key, iv);

  let ciphertext = cipher.update(plaintext, 'utf8');
  ciphertext = Buffer.concat([ciphertext, cipher.final()]);

  const tag = cipher.getAuthTag();

  // Prepend IV and tag to ciphertext
  return Buffer.concat([iv, tag, ciphertext]);
}
```

**Teaching Points:**

- ✅ Copilot chose AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- ✅ Copilot used crypto.randomBytes (cryptographically secure)
- ✅ Copilot used 12-byte IV (correct for GCM mode)
- ✅ Copilot extracted authentication tag
- ✅ Copilot prepended IV/tag to ciphertext (correct storage pattern)

**Key Message:**
"Copilot didn't just autocomplete - it made five security-critical decisions correctly. This is security knowledge embedded in the AI."

const privateKey = fs.readFileSync('private.key');

function generateToken(userId, roles) {
  return jwt.sign(
    {
      iss: 'https://auth.example.com',
      sub: userId,
      aud: 'https://api.example.com',
      exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (15 * 60), // 15 minutes
      iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      roles: roles
    },

## ⚠️ Common Demo Pitfalls

**Technical:**

- [ ] Copilot not generating expected code (use Copilot Chat as backup)
- [ ] GHAS not enabled on repository (enable before demo)
- [ ] Azure CLI not authenticated (run `az login` before demo)
- [ ] CodeQL workflow not running (trigger manually if needed)

**Timing:**

- [ ] Terraform generation can be verbose (use Copilot Chat, not inline)
- [ ] CodeQL scans take 2-3 minutes (have pre-run scan ready)
- [ ] Key Vault operations need Azure resources (pre-create if showing live)

**Teaching:**

- [ ] Don't just show code generation - explain WHY it's secure
- [ ] Connect Copilot outputs to security principles (OWASP, NIST)
- [ ] Show both successful generation AND GHAS validation

---

## 🚀 Recording Tips

**Before Recording:**

- Test all Copilot prompts (ensure they generate expected output)
- Have pre-run GHAS scans ready (CodeQL takes time)
- Pre-create Azure resources (Key Vault, VNet) if showing live
- Have backup screenshots of successful generations

**During Recording:**

- Read Copilot prompts slowly (students will copy them)
- Pause after generation to highlight security features
- Explain WHY generated code is secure, not just WHAT it does
- Show GHAS validation immediately after generation

**Key Transitions:**

- "Let's see what Copilot suggests..." (before generation)
- "Notice that Copilot..." (highlight security features)
- "GHAS validates this by..." (show validation)
- "In production, you would..." (connect to real-world use)
